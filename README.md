Course Objective:
Public key cryptography plays a major role in maintaining the security and integrity of commu- nication channels. However, due to the advent of quantum computing, existing public-key cryptographic algorithms like RSA or elliptic curve cryptography will cease to remain secure. Shor’s algorithm can find prime factors of integers numbers efficiently on quantum computers, thus undermining the basic security assumption of RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. Recognizing this, NIST in 2017 started a post-quantum secure public-key cryptography standardization procedure. The algorithms submitted on the NIST post-quantum standardization procedure can be classified  into five different categories:  1) Lattice 2) Code 3) Hash 4) Isogeny and 5) Multivariate.   In this course, we are going to focus on different post-quantum secure public-key algorithms that have been submitted in the NIST post-quantum standardization algorithms, focusing on both key encapsulation and digital signature algorithms.  The course apart from the detailed discussion on the functionality  of these cryptographic algorithms would also focus on the hardware implementation and side-channel security of these algorithms. The contents selected for the course are based on re- search papers from top-tier  journals and conferences such as IEEE TIFS, IACR  TCHES, IEEE TC, ACM  TECS, IEEE TVLSI, DAC, DATE,  etc.
